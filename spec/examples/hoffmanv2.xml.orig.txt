             An Example of Using XML for an Internet Draft
                        draft-example-of-xml-00

Abstract

   This is an example of an abstract.  It is a short paragraph that
   gives an overview of the document in order to help the reader
   determine whether or not they are interested in reading further.

Disclaimer

   This isn't a real RFC, just an example.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on March 5, 2015.

1.  Introduction

   This is the first paragraph of the introduction to this document.
   This introduction is probably much shorter than it would be for a
   real Internet Draft.

   Something to note about this paragraph is that it has a pointer to
   Section 2, and one to Figure 1, both of which appear later in the
   document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Protocol Being Described

   This is a reference to [RFC6949].  Actually, the reference itself is
   not all that interesting, but the way that the reference is
   incorporated is.  Note that the inclusion of RFC 2119 was done at the
   top of the XML, while the information for RFC 6949 is done directly
   in the references section.

   The IETF web site [1] is _quite_ *nice*, "isn't it"?  Unlike other
   web sites, it doesn't use


   gratuitous vertical space.

3.  Basic Lists

   Bulleted lists are good for items that are not ordered:

   o  This is the first item.

   o  This is the second item.  Here comes a sub-list:

      *  This is the first sub-item.

      *  This is the second sub-item
         and some more detail on the second sub-item.

   o  This is the item after the sub-list.

Internet-Draft                 XML Example                September 2014


   Numbered lists are good for items that are ordered:

   1.  This is the first item.

   2.  This is the second item.  Here comes a sub-list, but with
       letters:

       A.  This is the first sub-item.

       B.  This is the second sub-item

   3.  This is the item after the sub-list.

   And an example of hanging indent.

   Trees          These are bigger plants

   Lichen         These are smaller plants

   And the always-interesting "format" for lists.

   --1--  An element that gets a funny bullet.

4.  Figures

   The following is a figure with a caption.  Also, it uses the
   ampersand (&) and less than (<) characters in the example text.

         The ampersand (&) and
         less than (<) are two characters
         that need escaping.

                       Figure 1: This could be haiku

   Here are two short figures with no titles and with odd alignment.

                       This might appear in the center.

                                        This might appear right-aligned.

   Here is a figure that is actually pulled from somewhere else.

5.  Tables

   The following is a table example.
