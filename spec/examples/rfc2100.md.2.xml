<t>This RFC is a commentary on the difficulty of deciding upon an
acceptably distinctive hostname for one's computer, a problem which
grows in direct proportion to the logarithmically increasing size of
the Internet.
</t>
<t>Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
</t>
<t>Except to TS Eliot.
</t>
<t>And, for that matter, to David Addison, who hates iambic pentameter.

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
The Naming of Hosts is a difficult matter,
    It isn't just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
    When I tell you, a host must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
First of all, there's the name that the users use daily,
    Such as venus, athena, and cisco, and ames,
Such as titan or sirius, hobbes or europa--
    All of them sensible everyday names.
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
    Some for the web pages, some for the flames:
Such as mercury, phoenix, orion, and charon--
    But all of them sensible everyday names.
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
But I tell you, a host needs a name that's particular,
    A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can it keep its home page perpendicular,
    And spread out its data, send pages world wide?
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
    Like lothlorien, pothole, or kobyashi-maru,
Such as pearly-gates.vatican, or else diplomatic-
    Names that never belong to more than one host.
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
But above and beyond there's still one name left over,
    And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover--
    But THE NAMESERVER KNOWS, and will us'ually confess.
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
When you notice a client in rapt meditation,
    The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
The code is engaged in a deep consultation
    On the address, the address, the address of its name:
</artwork></figure>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
            It's ineffable,
            effable,
            Effanineffable,
            Deep and inscrutable,
            singular
            Name.

<t>Thanks to Don Libes, Mark Lottor, and a host of twisted
individuals^W^Wcreative sysadmins for providing source material for
this memo, to Andrew Lloyd-Webber, Cameron Mackintosh, and a cast of
thousands (particularly including Terrance Mann) who drew my
attention to the necessity, and of course, to Thomas Stearns Eliot,
for making this all necessary.
