1.  Command name and code

                           RANDOMLY-LOSE    256

2.  Command meanings

   IAC WILL RANDOMLY-LOSE:
      The sender of this command REQUESTS permission to, or confirms
      that it will, randomly lose.

   IAC WON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE:
      The sender of this command REFUSES to randomly lose.

   IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE:
      The sender of this command REQUESTS that the receiver, or grants
      the receiver permission to, randomly lose.

   IAC DON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE:
      The command sender DEMANDS that the receiver not randomly lose.

3.  Default

       WON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE

       DON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE

   i.e., random lossage will not happen.

4.  Motivation for the option

   Several hosts appear to provide random lossage, such as system
   crashes, lost data, incorrectly functioning programs, etc., as part
   of their services.  These services are often undocumented and are in
   general quite confusing to the novice user.  A general means is
   needed to allow the user to disable these features.

Internet-Draft         TELNET RANDOMLY-LOSE Option            April 1978


5.  Description of the option

   The normal mode does not allow random lossage; therefore the system
   is not allowed to crash, mung user files, etc.  If the server wants
   to provide random lossage, it must first ask for permission from the
   user by sending IAC WILL RANDOMLY-LOSE.

   If the user wants to permit the server to randomly lose, it replys
   with IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE.  Otherwise it sends IAC DONT RANDOMLY-
   LOSE, and the server is forbidden from randomly losing.

   Alternatively, the user could request the server to randomly lose, by
   sending IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE, and the server will either reply with
   IAC WILL RANDOMLY-LOSE, meaning that it will then proceed to do some
   random lossage (garbaging disk files is recommended for an initial
   implementation).  Or, it could send IAC WONT RANDOMLY-LOSE, meaning
   that it insists upon being reliable.

   Since this is implemented as a TELNET option, it is expected that
   servers which do not implement this option will not randomly lose;
   ie, they will provide 100% reliable uptime.
